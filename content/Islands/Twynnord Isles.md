Sister islands at the northmost point of the continent.

The one on the cold half of the icebound have people, fewer than its sister island. Both are relatively unpopulated except for a few fisherman towns. The cold one is often visited by military  troops as grounds to train newer recruits to withstand and brave the harsh climate beyond the icebound. It has no icebound thralls or truly dangerous icecursed creatures apart from some fauna and critters; who could still surprise and hurt you, but non-lethal.

The flora is not very diverse; it has some hearty plants, mostly roots, bushes and some woods from trees capable of withstanding the permanent cold: lots of berry bushes, where recruits learn to forage- an important skill to have beyond the icebound.

The left island is home to most of the population; mostly fishermen, a few artisans who settled for special materials that can be obtained from the rightland without braving the mainland's icebound.

A lot of travellers come through, on recommendation of the [[Danji Monastery]], all of them looking for gear from the legendary blacksmith clan of [[The Hammerherd|The Hammerherd]]. A group of highly skilled blacksmith who travel across the lands but are known to stay for extended, irregular period of time on the leftland. Its proximity to the icebound means you can get both materials that are endemic to the places without the risk of major casualty; which means better prices.

***Notable Myth***

Somewhere within the rightland, is a vault hidden by the Hammerherd of some of their most well-crafted weapons, including the sorcerer's staff that caused the Icecursed Cataclysm that centuries ago; it is said to have been made by the first of the Hammerherds; to whom it was returned by the ghostly figure of the legendary sorcerer who caused the cataclysm which plunged half of the continent in an [[Icecursed Cataclysm]]- the worst of it can be seen the closer you get to the Shivershores & [[Icecursed Isles]]- the latter which no one dares enter for fear that they may never come back.
