The Bloomfang is a species of beasts that were created by the experiment of a mad clan of druids, obsessed with magically melding plant life and animal life together.

They had acquired a litter of small black lion cubs and in a series of experiments drove into them the essence of the rose bushes, they sprouted rose blooms upon their manes and bodies, and coarse vines filled with thorns wrapped around their bodies and limbs. Most of the litter died accidentally slashing and wounding each other with their newly sprouted thorns, only a couple pairs survived.

As they grew, so did their floral affliction, such as a rose bush, they became extremely territorial, protecting whatever they deemed theirs. Their thorns became weapons, their tails used as powerful whips, their claws deadly knives, only seconded by their sharp thorns which ran across their body. The beasts only had to tackle or run past a prey to shred their skin. The thorns would also grow towards their bodies, piercing their own flesh and contributing to their extremely aggressive nature, their fur would have patches of dark red over the black, from the blood that leaked from the wounds of their own thorns.

The ambitions of the druid clan spelled their own end, noticing that they could not control the increasingly agitated beasts as they grew, they sought to kill them in their sleep. One fateful night, they went into their enclosure, now each beast taller than two men, slept nestled against their partners, close enough to share warmth but far enough as not to hurt each other with their thorns. Unfortunately, the beasts sensing their presence arose and a crimson affair followed. All of druids clan were slaughtered and mangled and the Bloomfangs fled into the night.

Many years later, the wealthy merchant house of Valen found a bountiful litter of cubs next to the body of their parents, the mother seemingly died to injuries incurred during labour, pushing out the thorns had caused her to bleed out. The male was found just beyond their Den, with bite marks and slashes all over its body. It seemed that through the pain and panic of labour, the female had lost control of herself and grievously wounded her partner.

House Valen, claimed the beasts as their own and tamed them, tending to thorns and fury alike, employing both beast masters and gardeners, they achieved what the druids could not- Deadly, beautiful and loyal beasts. From henceforth, the Bloomfang became the sigil of the house, which eventually rose to nobility, renaming themselves in the honour of their pride and power; Valenthorn.
