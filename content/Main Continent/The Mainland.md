The origin of the main continent is shrouded in mystery. Most scholars who have studied the lands and its whims over the centuries have theorized that the giant volcano to the west must be the reason for most, if not all, of the landmass.

Despite [[The Cinderpeak]] being dormant now, it still rumbles every few decades- which never fails to have the older generations of Karcerian on their knees praying, and the younger ones talking about what would actually happen if the slumbering inferno ever did wake up again.

You cannot restrain the imagination of the youth but their elders never fail to tell them, in the same solemn and terrified tone, that whatever nightmarish hellscape they may imagine, reality would be vastly worse. There are barely any witnesses left from the volcano's precious awakening, most of them perished in the cataclysm, the rest died of its consequences over time... or old age. After all, it had been ages, even the oldest of the Fel'rae are only a century or so old- and if they did not have it in memory, neither did we.
