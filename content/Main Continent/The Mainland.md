The origin of the main continent is shrouded in mystery. Most scholars who have studied the lands and its whims over the centuries have theorized that the giant volcano to the west must be the reason for most, if not all, of the landmass.

Despite [[The Cinderpeaks]] being dormant now, it still rumbles every few decades- which never fails to have the older generations of Karcerian on their knees praying, and the younger ones talking about what would actually happen if the slumbering inferno ever did wake up again.

You cannot restrain the imagination of the youth but their elders never fail to tell them, in the same solemn and terrified tone, that whatever nightmarish hellscape they may imagine, reality would be vastly worse. There are barely any witnesses left from the volcano's previous awakening, most of them perished in the cataclysm, the rest died of its consequences over time... or old age. After all, it had been ages, even the oldest of the Fel'rae are only a century or so old- and if they did not have it in memory, neither did we.

The secrets archive of the Valenthorn tells the creation story of Karceros and reveals a dark truth about the land its people.

Ages ago, Karceros did not exist. All who now dwell upon it were sentenced to its shores. All of them hail from a distant land, to the north, beyond the Evermyst, the continent of NAME TBD. At the time the lands were in an era regarded as peaceful, and the king had reigned for many years... however, peace does not sit well with everyone. 

Amongst the court, and the common people, there were those who wanted to see this era ended and a new one ushered in its stead. To this intent, a coalition between noble houses and influential, powerful people was made. At the head of it, was none other than the secret lover of the King, Heylel [[Valenthorn]]. Heylel was known for his good looks and charming personality, but a facet that he kept hidden behind his youthful smile was a dark and ambitious one; one that would grasp at the crown, despite it sitting on his lover's head. 

The King and Heylel had known each other from youth, but him being noble-born and not royalty made their relationship impossible to the king, thus thus he married his wife, the Queen for power and influence but  kept his friend, lover and, unbeknownst to him, betrayer- close to his heart and bed. Inside Heylel, the refusal left a bitter taste in his mouth, after all hate & love was different faces upon the same coin. He played his part, and kept his privileges, until he was ready to reach for the throne.

His plans would have certainly succeeded, if it was not for the Prophetess Ayana, who heard on a fateful night, a song from the bones she tossed, a warning: 

"That Roses shall bloom upon the throne,
Thorns growing from the crown upon their brow,
Their roar would  splinter the land, 
and none would remember how"

Ayana, who foresaw the downfall of her beloved king, realised that the song was about the House of Valenthorn taking the crown. For it was their house which brandished the sigil of the [[Bloomfangs]], the beasts gilded with roses, and wrapped in thorns.
